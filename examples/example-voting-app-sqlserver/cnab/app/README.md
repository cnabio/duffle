Currently this version has a SQL Server image from the SQL Server on Linux private preview in the docker-compose.yml file.
In order to access that image, you need to be a participant in the SQL Server on Linux private preview.

Once you have access to the image, make sure that you run 'docker login' and login once to cache your credentials before you run 'docker-compose up'.

Currently, this version uses the new JSON query features of SQL Server 2016.

* A SQL Server
* A Node.js webapp which shows the results of the voting in real time

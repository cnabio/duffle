# Governance

## Project Maintainers
[Project maintainers](CODEOWNERS) are responsible for activities around maintaining and updating Duffle, the reference implementation for the [CNAB spec](https://github.com/cnabio/cnab-spec). Final decisions on the project reside with the project maintainers.

Maintainers MUST remain active. If they are unresponsive for >3 months, they will be automatically removed unless a [super-majority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermajority#Two-thirds_vote) of the other project maintainers agrees to extend the period to be greater than 3 months.

New maintainers can be added to the project by a [super-majority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermajority#Two-thirds_vote) vote of the existing maintainers.

A maintainer may step down by submitting an [issue](https://github.com/cnabio/duffle/issues/new) stating their intent.
